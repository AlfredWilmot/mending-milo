# mending-milo
Here I will outline my journey of learning how to improve the portability of my code

### Task (1): set-up and run the [ros2learn docker container](https://github.com/AcutronicRobotics/ros2learn/tree/dashing/docker)

- Notes
    1) Installation instructions for [ROS2 Dashing](https://docs.ros.org/en/dashing/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)
    2) Setting-up [Python venvs and venvwrappers](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)
    3) Supplement documentation with gifs using [Peek](https://vitux.com/install-peek-animated-gif-recorder-on-ubuntu/)
    4) Installing and managing [different version of Python3](https://www.itsupportwale.com/blog/how-to-upgrade-to-python-3-7-on-ubuntu-18-10/)
    5) Installing and using [Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04) 


ToDo:
- make a script that automates the installation of python venv stuff

Tired of sitting around mending broken code?
Have you tried going to the gym and [rebuilding milo](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54303312-rebuilding-milo) instead?
